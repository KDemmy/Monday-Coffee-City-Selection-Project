# Monday-Coffee-City-Selection-Project
This project analyzes Monday Coffeeâ€™s sales data (since January 2023) to identify the top 3 Indian cities for opening new coffee shops.   It demonstrates SQL querying, business analysis, and data-driven recommendations, making it a strong example of end-to-end problem solving with SQL.
